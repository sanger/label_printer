nginx was installed by default in ~/homebrew/etc/nginx
file nginx.conf was there, I added lines 37-49
if it is in another folder, root (line 41) should be changed
to start nginx run `nginx`, it runs on http://localhost:8080/

start pmb on http://localhost:9292

label templates and label types are in file 'LabelTemplates'

to run tests open http://localhost:8080/SpecRunner.html
